# 🎧 Spotify Analytics SQL Project

This project showcases a complete **SQL-based data pipeline** built around Spotify’s *Top Podcasts* dataset.

It demonstrates real-world **data engineering** and **analytics** concepts using **SQL Server**, including:

- 🪙 **Bronze layer** — raw data ingestion via `BULK INSERT`
- ⚙️ **Silver layer** — data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment
- 📊 **Gold layer** — reporting and analytical insights

The goal is to simulate a modern **data lakehouse workflow** entirely in SQL, preparing high-quality, query-ready data for **visualization** and **business intelligence tools**.
